# In order to avoid races with identity-providing services like SSSD or
# winbind, we need to ensure that Accounts Service starts after
# nss-user-lookup.target
After=nss-user-lookup.target lightdm.service
Wants=nss-user-lookup.target fprintd.service

# We pull this in by graphical.target instead of waiting for the bus
# activation, to speed things up a little: gdm uses this anyway so it is nice
# if it is already around when gdm wants to use it and doesn't have to wait for
# it.
